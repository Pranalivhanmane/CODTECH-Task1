Overview of Project
Here is an overview of the key points and statements of a basic calculator program:

 1. Prompting the User for Input
   - The program should first ask the user to input two numeric values, which will serve as the operands for the calculation.
   - The input values can be of any numeric type, such as integers or floating-point numbers, depending on the desired precision for calculations.

2. Asking the User to Choose an Operation
   - After receiving the two numbers, the program will present the user with a menu of available operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - The user will be prompted to enter a choice corresponding to one of these operations.

3. Performing the Selected Operation
   - Based on the user's choice, the program will perform the appropriate arithmetic operation on the two entered numbers.
   - The operations are: 
     1.Addition: Add the two numbers.
     2.Subtraction: Subtract the second number from the first.
     3.Multiplication: Multiply the two numbers.
     4.Division: Divide the first number by the second, with special handling for division by zero.

 4. Error Handling
     If the user selects division and attempts to divide by zero, the program should check for this condition and display an error message, avoiding a runtime error.
     The program should also handle invalid user inputs, such as choosing an operation that isn't on the list.

 5. Displaying the Result
     After performing the chosen operation, the program should display the result to the user in a clear and understandable format.
     The result should reflect the operation that was performed, showing the outcome of the arithmetic calculation.

 6. Program Flow
   The program uses conditional statements (like if-else or switch) to determine which operation to execute based on the user's input.
   After the calculation is completed, the result is shown to the user before the program ends.

Key Concepts:
  User Input: Gathering numeric values and the operation choice.
  Conditional Logic: Deciding which operation to perform based on user input.
  Arithmetic Operations: Executing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  Error Handling: Managing potential issues, such as division by zero or invalid input.

Output: Displaying the final result of the operation.
