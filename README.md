Overview of the Online Banking System Project
This project aims to develop a simple online banking system in Java that enables users to perform various banking operations, such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, transferring money between accounts, viewing transaction history, and managing personal information.

Features of the Online Banking System:
Account Creation: Users can create a new bank account by providing their personal information such as name, email, address, and initial deposit.
Deposit and Withdrawal: Users can deposit money into their accounts and withdraw funds as required.
Money Transfer: Users can transfer funds between different accounts within the system by specifying the recipient's account details and the amount.
Transaction History: Users can view a history of all their transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
Manage Personal Information: Users can update their personal information such as address, phone number, and email.
Authentication: Users need to authenticate themselves before accessing their accounts.
Technologies Used:
Java: The programming language for implementing the system's logic and functionality.
Java Collections (List, Map): For storing account details, transactions, and user data.
Java I/O: For saving account data and transaction history to files for persistence.
Project Breakdown
1. Account Class:
Represents a bank account.
Contains information like account number, account holder's name, balance, transaction history, etc.
Methods: deposit, withdraw, transfer, and display transaction history.
2. Bank Class:
Manages multiple user accounts.
Provides methods to create an account, search for an account by account number, and perform various banking operations.
3. Transaction Class:
Represents a transaction (deposit, withdrawal, or transfer).
Contains details like transaction type, amount, and date.
4. BankingSystem Class:
Provides the user interface and handles user interaction.
Users can log in to their account and perform operations like viewing their balance, transferring funds, etc.
A simple text-based menu can be used for user interaction.

Key Points:
Account Creation: The system generates a unique account number for each new account and stores it.
Deposits and Withdrawals: The user can deposit funds into and withdraw from their account.
Transfers: The system allows for transfers between accounts within the bank.
Transaction History: Each action (deposit, withdrawal, transfer) is logged in the transaction history.
Persistence: For a fully functional system, user data and transaction history would ideally be saved in files or a database (e.g., using serialization or a database like MySQL).
Conclusion:
This Java-based Online Banking System demonstrates how to create and manage accounts, perform financial transactions, and maintain transaction history in a simple console-based application. It serves as a foundation for more complex banking systems, such as adding user authentication, supporting multiple users, and integrating with external banking systems or APIs.
